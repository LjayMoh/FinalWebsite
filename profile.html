                    <p>
                        I am a very humble, kind, loving, caring, creative, supportive, God-fearing, faithful, smart, and patient being,
                        I always try to find the good in every person I connect with, and give the opportunity to be in my circle.
                        I believe that we all deserve many chances in life to prove to ourselves and others that we can be better and do better.
                        Waking up everyday is a lucky chance for all of us to be better humans than we were yesterday.
                    </p>
             
                    <p>
                         I was born and raised in the Vaal and completed my matric back in 2018, I then took a gap year to upgrade my marks in 2019, I chose to go upgrade my Physical Science 
                         and Mathematics marks. My special achievements and honours thus far, are being a debating and public speaking team member in my high school years in 2016-2017, I was also in the top 3 matric best preforming learners in 2018. 
                         I applied for different courses at different institutions, then accepted the offer to go study at <em>University of the Witwatersrand</em> in Johannesburg.
                         I got accepted to join the <em>Wits School of Arts in Digital Arts</em>  which really got me thrilled because I love art wholeheartedly. At first, I had no idea what was expected of me in the 
                         Digital Arts course, but I grew to understand and engage more with it. My first year was not much of an experience and I did not get the chance to grasp the fact that I was no longer a high school kid,
                         due to unforeseen circumstances we had to do online learning, and trust me, it was not easy; but we pulled through. As we all know hardwork pays, I got a distinction in Elementary Isizulu Language and Culture in first year.
                         My main goal in this course is to make use of my capacity to think creatively in a position that will challenge me and enhance personal development by exploiting my skill in digital arts. I want to attain 
                         specialization in <strong>Animation</strong> and <strong>Interactive Media</strong>.
                    </p>
             
                    <p>
                         I did not think I was going to be able to manage till this far, because I had to go study at home and there were so many distractions and challenges.
                         Gratefully, I passed all my modules, even though they were not the marks I was hoping for, I am thankful that I did not have to repeat any of them. One thing I have learnt thu far in this course is that team work and engagemment with others 
                         helps so much, giving feedback and thoughts to whatever you engage with can help you understand its core message, asking yourself why? Like why do we play games for fun? Is very important. As it will answer many questions and make the information
                         we capture and take part in make sense. In this course we learn, investigate and interrogate why and how the developing digital innovations have and still are changing our lives.
                    </p>
             
                    <p>
                         Now I am a third year <em>Digital Arts</em> student in the <em>Wits School of Arts</em>. I chose to major in Interactive Media and Animation, I have no regrets for the choice I made as I am enjoying the two modules
                         so far, even though I feel like there is going to be a lot of work as time goes, I am ready to do the best I can. As they say, when you do not apply pressure, you will feel it! I really enjoy creating websites, animating, and writing 
                         critical reflections on the readings we engage with each week brings so much enlightenment and knowledge, even though there might be a lot of pressure, I like the two modules so far.  To dig deeper into understanding how information is communicated in 
                         differnt ways due to the digital era and how it shapes political, social, economic, and government engagements is just mind blowing and eye-opening.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       I am looking forward to learning more and gain knowledge about even the small things that exist in this world!
