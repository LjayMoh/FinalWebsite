                <p>
                    The article gives us enlightenment on how geographic information is important and how it gives us knowledge about a specific environment. 
                    Below I will give an in-depth discussion of the text, the discussion will include the aims, methodology and results, and a critical reflection on their conclusions.
                    We always seek to find more information about different things that surround us, for example, we want to find information about the economy, places, health care, politics, and so on.
                    This information that we access on the internet has its place of origin, meaning it comes from parts unknown and it unfolds in someplace. Any type of information is brought to terms by economic-development, web systems,
                    and telecommunications, which all exist in visible places (Graham et al. 2005: 88). The geology of information shapes how we live and can understand how different parts of the world function.
                    The way information was provided and transferred back then versus currently is quite different, for instance, back in the days the information was transported through "word of mouth" or by telling stories. 
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    Different groups of people used to believe every information they received and used that information to bring division in terms of culture and tradition all over the world. Latour in Graham et al. refers to "immutable mobiles" as a term that was
                    created by the adaptability and movability of information which created the force to restrain the changeability of information, the phrase is explained as information that can be shared without any change to its message (Graham et al. 2015: 89). 
                    Technological innovations brought a lot of change to how information is transferred and how people can contribute, share, and access it. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) became known and was used by corporations, institutions,
                    and governments to share and communicate information, this resulted in immutable mobiles becoming important and required. Immutable mobiles gave information power to influence people and change how they live, think, and interact with one another. 
                    They have affected the rendering of locations and formed informational corrugations of locales in a mobile container (Wilson in Graham et al. 2015: 89). In addition, ICT cleared the way for <em>(im)mutable augmentations</em> which are indicated by the patterning of 
                    effective information on all parts of a geographic area (Graham et al. 2015:89). This means that geography has layers of information as well and this information can and cannot be changed. The changeable and unchangeable developments of information are supreme because 
                    they affect and structure the way we recognize and notice other locales. Graham and other authors had specific sights they aimed to share with the readers when they wrote this article.

                    <h1 class="ref">Aims.</h1> 
                    <p>
                        The main aim of this article was to produce the primary establishment for the research that information geography is the same as, and it leads us to information development, and this development is the one that provides us with academic information based on what we research. 
                        The authors’ other aims were to give an investigation how information geographies have their geographic location; to show us that geographic information itself is permeated by an arrangement of uneven geographies. Lastly, they aimed to provide a comprehensive observation of
                        a variety of principles that bring to terms and hold, as well as convey different types of geographic information making use of the integration of existing evidence that was never explored (Graham et al. 2015: 88-89).

                    <h1 class="ref">The methodology and the results.</h1>
                    <p>
                        The authors shape the body of the article in a way that will make it easy for the reader to engage with the information, easily navigate it, and understand what the focus of the given information is, they grouped their information by focusing on the following sub-topics: 
                        Pre-digital geographies of information, Changing geographies after the information revolution, Geographies of access and enablement, Geographies of participation, Geographies of representation, and the Conclusion (Graham et al. 2015).
                    </p> 
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    During the <strong>pre-digital era</strong>, this is before the widespread of digital technologies information was not able to be collected and kept for future references, which made information to be hard to find. A lot of information was geographically fixed, and there was
                    only a limited amount of information that people could access. Since most information was in printed books, there were constraints to how the books were designed, where they were being stored, and the amount of information they carried. Even though in the pre-digital age, 
                    information was able to be systemized, it was neither able to change its inherent form nor be transported across the world. I believe this is the reason why we ended up having different divisions of the world, where we find different traditions, languages, cultures, races, and so on;
                    all these were the results of keeping the information in one locale, the information had the political, social, and economic authority (Graham et al.2015:90), to shape the environment and its people.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    The <strong>digital era</strong> unfolded, and the transferring of information also had revolutionary changes in how it was used and created. According to Graham et al., the change in information was caused by the "information age" which is the reproduction of socio-technical arrangements (2015: 90). 
                    The system is the greater accessibility of computers, and technical tools that can receive and transfer information, the system can also be referred to as the geographic information system (GIS) which is a system of computer data, hardware, and software that makes it manageable to put in, control, 
                    analyze, and offer data about the information of a specific place (Ali, 2020:1).  Using GIS information can easily be collected, stored, managed, and analyzed over and over again. Everyone can now access any type of information they are searching for, without any limitations and restrictions.
                    This digital age allows people to add their views and opinions to the content they would like to interact with, they are now able to take the authority to change societies and have a say in developments. To answer many questions about whether the freedom of participation to access and add opinions to 
                    information has changed information geographies and the geographies of information; Graham et al. split their research into three classifications, these are: "geographies of access and enablement" which focus on the investigation of who can access the computers for digital engagement, conviction, and characterization.
                    The second one is “geographies of participation”, and this indicator is about what gave rise to the specific information. Lastly, “geographies of representation” is the investigation of which parts of information are innovated and not innovated (2015: 91).
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    The <strong>geographies of access and enablement</strong> give observations on digital presentation, and engagement; it also investigates the number of users that can access the internet all over the world. From the research that was conducted, results were found that the integration of Japan, India, and China holds the largest number 
                    of internet users, more than North America and Europe integrated (Graham et al.2015: 92). Some countries in Africa have shown more growth in internet use while others are still experiencing little change. In the past three years, nearly all the countries in North African countries increased their size of internet use population, 
                    South Africa is one of the countries that saw great growth in internet population. Above twenty sub-Saharan African countries have been experiencing slow growth in the number of internet users. The high unemployment rate in most countries in Africa is what causes the internet population to be low because the costs of using it were
                    ranged between 10-250% of the mean salary, the issue is not the cost but being unemployed and having a low mean salaries (Graham et al. 2015: 92).  Most parts of the world remain without internet access because of the inability to afford it,  the costs high are the ones that brought worldwide digital division. 
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    When it comes to <strong>geographies of participation</strong>, three factors are explored, these are, the name of areas that indicates the information constructed on the Webpage, GitHub users focusing on the engagements to the largest application software repository in the world, and Wikipedia edits focusing on engagements with the largest encyclopedia in the world.
                    The results the authors observed when they were comparing the three indicators were pointing out ways in which different platforms form user participation in the transferring of information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <em>name of the areas</em> system provides users with the locations where the digital information originates, which was implemented in the late 1980s. They are used by individuals, organizations, and businesses trying to make their contents discoverable (Graham et al. 2015:93). There are different types of domain names, and the name depends on the country, for instance, 
                    .za is the digital name used mostly in South Africa. A country can have many domain names, but a small number of internet users, and it can have fewer domain names with many internet users. Some countries choose to have many domain names because they make it easy for their information to be found. 
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    <em>GitHub Software</em> is the most used coding program in the world, currently with 73 million registered developers and above 200 million repositories (Wikipedia, 2021). This developer program is the most used because it enables developers to invent and share their codes with others for them to use and engage with other users while working on projects as a branch. 
                    From the results of the survey, Africa then was found to have the lowest number of contributors to this program, with the lowest number of participants compared to other countries, while Europe and North America has the highest number of participants than the rest of other parts of the world (Graham et al. 2015: 96).
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>Wikipedia</em> is an information program that allows users to contribute to the sharing of content. It is one of the top twenty websites that users use to access information, it is well known to have information in different languages as it has the authority to structure information given to internet users (Graham et al. 2015:96). 
                    It allows everyone with internet access to participate and share their thoughts or facts by editing information on the encyclopedia in any language the user prefers. From the investigation of how Wikipedia contributes to geographies of participation, it led to results that there has been evidence of inequality in the contributions, 
                    most information that is recorded on the website is from the UK, USA, France, and Germany, while a low number of edits from the Middle East and Africa are recorded. How the locales and information are created in different divisions of the world makes the geographies of participation matter, since the information will not be the same and it will give different opinions (Graham et al. 2015:97).
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    Understanding the investigation of the <strong>geographies of representation</strong>, digital representations were analyzed namely: <em>Google Search</em> commonly known as an engine to explore information, <em>OpenStreetMap</em> used to give locale information and view maps, and <em>Semantic Web</em> which is one of the well-known cooperatives for the foundation of knowledge (Graham et al. 2015: 98). 
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    <em>Google Search</em> is an exceptionally used exploring engine that has content that affects the representation of locales. Country names were used to conduct that research, and this resulted in a tree map, which showed the information of each country in an area of a rectangle with each country being allocated a specific color correlating with its world region. 
                    Shades were used to allocate the countries, lighter shades were used to indicate countries with a lower number of website pages per internet user, while the darker shade indicates countries with a higher number of website pages per internet user (Graham et al. 2015: 98).
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    <em>OpenStreetMap</em> is a platform that is used for showing routes and is used by many digital services and platforms because of its free accessibility.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    The <em>semantic Web</em> is a development that was created to make the web more usable by allowing data to be able to move and be shared across the world. Its aim I could say was to make the information that Google gives to the users easy to understand and engage with instead of showing complex information like graphic results. 
                    Geonames and Freebase are important back-end databases of the semantic web, Freebase is the comprehension substructure of the web, and Geonames is the index of locale names. In some parts of the results, it was shown that even though the United States has below 5% of the population of the world, it still has the largest focus in Freebase with 45% of names (Graham et al. 2015: 99-100).
                </p>
                    

                <p>
                    <h1 class="ref">Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>
                        The authors elaborate that information always has its geographic place of origin, and this has an impact on the division that was brought into this world.
                        I tend to agree with this because we engage with information in different ways from different places, we often do not use one medium to interact with this information.
                        I believe the place of origin then depends on the type of media we use to engage with the information, and we should take into consideration that the content shapes 
                        the medium while the medium influences and forms societal beliefs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The article used data that was never analyzed to investigate its core aims, their aims on investigating the impacts geographies of information have on the content and development intrigued me to read further.
                        Their methodology creates an easy flow for the delivery of the message, they ensured that they use sub-topics to gives out arguments and facts with evidences. 
                        The authors also showed us the illustrations of the collected data to make us understand the information better. These illustrations are something we are supposed to take into consideration as different countries and as indivisuals,
                        because we are all affected when it comes to voicing our thoughts and opinions, especially in African countries.
                        It was investigated that many countries in Africa are still developing when it comes to internet use and participation. Most information in the search engines is displayed in the English language, even when all the countries are allowed to participate in editing information on the encyclopedia, a small percentage 
                        of the African-language information is recorded, all these signify inequality within internet contribution. Many countries in Africa are unable to have internet access due to the low employment rate and the high cost of the internet, which limits their contributions and participation in sharing and using codes in the GitHub program.
                        This is an issue because we get information that is about African cultures, traditions, beliefs, as well as economic and political information but was not specifically written by Africans as they can tell the experience better and in their languages. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The (im)mutable developments affect how information is being transferred, many people are now able to contribute to the implementations of the content they want to be shared and engaged with due to the growth in digital augmentations. Information can be both mutable and immutable, it can change how there are now geographies of participation which enable readers to edit the information and share their own
                        opinions in their preferred languages, the change can also be brought by the change in mediums, whereby printed books can now be eBooks which are accessible through the internet. Information back then was not able to be changed because it was restricted from moving across the world, meaning people had to believe whatever information they engaged with and shape their societies based on it.
                        The article broke down the geographies of information and information geographies, it enlightens us and gives us food for thought that we must think deeper and broadly about where information is from, who is it referred to, how is it created, and how it shapes us and our environments.
                    </p>   
                    

                    <p>
                        For future research, we must investigate the characteristics that led to countries not being in the same average internet accessibility, we should investigate how other countries get to succeed while others are still at their lowest. We need to put our focal point on how informational authority is influenced by the post-colonial modes. Research on how the political economy is
                        responsible for the unequal geographies of information will enlighten many societies to improve their internet engagement and want to contribute in information that is shared about them and their historical concerns.
