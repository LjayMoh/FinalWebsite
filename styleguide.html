            <article class="style-nav">
                <h1 class="ref">Font</h1>
                <p>
                    I chose to use Times New Roman from the font-family for the texts in all the pages,this is because most people are familiar with it,
                    and it is used in many texts, also because it is easy to read and suitable for reading plain text. I used different
                    font-sizes to best suit the layout and to show which text is the heading or gives more important information.
                </p>

                <h1 class="ref">Graphics</h1>
                <p>
                    For the background of each page I used universe images from <a href="h-card">unsplash.com</a>, I chose to use these images as the backgrounds to make
                    the pages attractive. This time I used dark imgaes as possible so that the text will not blend into the background and make it difficult for the user to read it.
                    Other graphics I included are my drawings in the portfolio page and the illustrations of the wireframing in wireframes page. 
                </p>

                <h1 class="ref">Color</h1>
                <p>
                    I did not use too many colours to design this website because I wanted to keep everything simple and easy to look at. I used black, 
                    white/cream white, light-pink, light blue/ aqua blue, grey, and dark green. For all the paragraph texts in each page I used the color white or cream white,
                    this is because white signifies simplicity and clarity, I also did not want to use colors that would blend in to the background by any chance. 
                    For the information in the footer like the referencing and explanation of what Interactive Media is, as well as the contact icons; I used black for the text so that it can 
                    signify to the viewer the power and elegance of that information; I used grey for the background color of the footer to show the user the balance between the information in the body section and the One
                    in the footer section and bottom. I used light pink for the sub-headings, because I wanted to give them some youthfulness, to make the reader flow into reading the texts.
                    Then for the links in every page and the text on the footer bottom I used aqua blue or light blue, because I wanted them to stand out and show some stability and balance to the text.
                    Then lastly, when the user hovers on the links I used the dark-green background color to show them that they can click the text and to give them stability and importance of the information it holds.
                </p>

                <h1 class="ref">Layout</h1>
                <p>
                    For the layout of this website I decided to keep everything simple and make the visuals eye-catchy, hence I used images for the 
                    background of each page to complement the content that the page holds, I did my best to keep the text simple and use appropriate words.
                    My aim was to ensure a smooth flow of the work with order and making the viewer understand the information on each page without any confusion.
                    For the home page I decided to use the auto play slider to display the weekly blog posts, which included, a complementary image with the information
                    in the blog, name of the author, and the date the post was posted. I went for this layout because I wanted to keep the page attractive and make it easy for
                    the user to navigate throuh the page and choose the post they would like to read effortlessly. I made sure that I include links to important content on each page,
                    so that the user does not have to navigate back to the homepage to access the links to pages they want to engage with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used the same layout for the blog posts, style guide, profile, portfolio, wireframes, and reflection pages; which included the title of the post with links to the home, 
                    profile, and portfolio pages on the far-top left of the screen. The body section with the needed information, then the footer and footer bottom.
