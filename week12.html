                    Every design goes through design questions before the final product can be decided, most designers
                    make prototypes to check the level of usability of their products. As Papanek states in his reading that “Should 
                    I design it to be functional or to be aesthetically pleasing?” and “Do you want it to look good or to work?” (1985:7),
                    are the most complex questions that designers ask when making decisions about their designs. These questions help them to reach 
                    an understanding of how they will make the designs purposeful.  So now, I am going to briefly explain the user interface and user experience
                    and discuss how integrating them can help design a better product. Then I will thoroughly discuss how I used user interface and experience to reach my design choices.

                    <h1 class="ref">What is the User Interface?</h1>
                    <p>
                        A user interface allows the user to interact with the design, it shows the visual design of a product. Its purpose is to make the design look able, meaningful,
                        and attractive. It gives the design an aesthetic look and brings a psychological and spiritual connection between the user and the design (Goldberg, 2022), for instance,
                        some users may experience nostalgia by just looking at the beauty of the design. It is more like the face of the design before the user can engage with the inner system and its function.
                        There are three important elements of user interface that designers should take into consideration when creating their designs, these are, visual representations which focus on the aspects 
                        that give the design an aesthetic feel, for instance, layout, colour, graphics, typography and so on. The interactive representation focuses on the user input and gives the user the opportunity to navigate the design easily,
                        and examples can be buttons to enable the user to move from one place to another and show active participation. The last element is information planning this is making sure that the structuring of the content enables an easy use
                        for navigation by including search bars, buttons, terminologies and so on (Indeed Editorial Team, 2021). Users find symmetrical designs easier to understand than asymmetrical designs, this is because symmetry is full of simplicity (Papanek, 1985, 4-5), 
                        but it all depends on how the design is structured that will make it legible and readable. Designing a good UI is always thinking about the user in mind and how to make the site accessible to them and easy to interact with.

                    <h1 class="ref">What is User Experience?</h1>
                    <p>
                        User experience is what makes the interfaces have a purpose and gives them functionality. It is what makes the users see if they are accomplishing their goals or not (Goldberg, 2022). 
                        It mostly focuses on the usability of the design, it gives the ideas for the design of the product before its interface can be created, these ideas can be given using prototypes, research, wireframes, copywriting and so on.
                        UX involves specifying user expectations through vend research and developing ideas on that information, getting it to read for innovations, and then marketing (Indeed Editorial Team, 2021).  The design of user experience figures 
                        out how the needs of users can be met by planning and testing different ideas and asking users to participate in giving useful feedback for the prototypes.    
                    </p>

                <p>
                    <h1 class="ref">How to see a good UI and UX.</h1>
                    <p>
                        A design starts with the foundation, which is the user experience. Every designer must do research before they get to the process of designing the interfaces, 
                        they should have a certain goal(s) they are willing to accomplish with their design and consider users' expectations when designing the work. Strategizing, wireframing,
                        prototyping, testing, developing, and copywriting (Indeed Editorial Team, 2021) are what will make the design have a good user experience, because they open doors for the 
                        designer to get feedback and ideas, they might have forgotten to add on the design form the targeted users and other designers. A good user interface is determined by good 
                        usability as it is the foundation of the design, the design must be readable with the information structured well, aesthetically pleasing, responsive, have good contrast, 
                        be functional, as well as be user-centred by knowing the point at the user.

                    <h1 class="ref">My UI and UX.</h1>
                    <p>
                        When I was designing my user interface, I was focused on making the design readable with good usability, a simple layout, with simple graphics. The first website user 
                        interface design was to that pleasing because there were times when the text blended in with the background image and this made it hard for the user to understand the information.
                        I found this out from the feedback I receive from the marker, also the navigation at some point was a bit complex. I used the feedback I received as an advantage to help me design 
                        a better website this time around, I will explain a few elements I used on my user interface below.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<strong>Layout</strong>: For the layout, I decided to use simple structures that will not be complex for the user to see the content. For instance,
                         I decided to use the same layout structure for the blog post webpages.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<strong>Colour</strong>: Same as the first website, I made use of the RGB colour palette, this includes colours that are colour-blind-friendly 
                         and not harsh to the eyes, e.g., black, blue, dusty pink, and cream-white.    
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<strong>Colour</strong>: Same as the first website, I made use of the RGB colour palette, this includes colours that are colour-blind-friendly
                        and not harsh to the eyes, e.g., black, blue, dusty pink, and cream-white.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<strong>Graphics</strong>: For the background I used images, I used the same image for the blog posts backgrounds, 
                        then different images for the home, profile, portfolio, style guide, wireframes, and reflection pages. I used images that will show and not 
                        blend with the text to make it easy for the user to read it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<strong>Typography</strong>: The highest font size I used is 30pixels for the headings, I use the same type of font I used on the first website 
                        which is Times New Roman, this is because it is common and easy to read.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For my user experience, I used the rubric, research, feedback from the previous website, and wireframes to ensure that I meet the required expectations. 
                        My aim this time was to make sure that the information is readable and understandable, and that the navigation is smooth throughout.
                    </p>

                    <p>   
                        In conclusion, both user interface and user experience are important, UI makes the design meet the expectations of users by ensuring that there is a vivid interaction 
                        between the user and the program of the site. It brings spiritual, emotional, and intellectual connections between the user and the design. UX focuses on the functionality 
                        and importance of the design, it takes into consideration the users the design is meant to target, meaning it is the foundation of the design process whereby ideas are shared 
                        and prototyped before the final product.
