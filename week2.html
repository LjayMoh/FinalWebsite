                    New technologies always have an impact on social and political outcomes, they have authority to change how people are engaging with one another and new mediums.
                    A lot of people back in the days have always used general knowledge, and their skills to do work this meant there were more jobs than now. Technology innovations and new
                    human interrelations have reduced the percentage of employment rate. This is because digital developments have created roles for people, for example, there are now machines that 
                    knit clothes, when back in the days clothes were mostly sewed with hands.

                    According to McLuhan things that do not spell out names or have any texts are considered as pure information; the message for any medium is created by what humans do with it. The ways they use it
                    is what gives it meaning and value, then the message will thereof shape and control human activities and interactions. He refers to the electric light as a medium with no “content” meaning it is a medium 
                    without a message since it has no verbal communication, so it is not seen as a communication medium. The information of any medium is always another medium, this simply means that every medium always has another medium backing it,
                    for instance, the content of reading is to learn (McLuhan, 1964:203-204). I tend to agree with McLuhan on his point that a medium that has no verbal modes has no content, and its core message will be determines by what people chose 
                    to use it for, lets take a desk for example,it is was just a structure with a flat surface with no meaning, until humans decides to use it at offices, school, home etc. for placing other equipments like a Laptop, also for writing and reading.
                    All these human activities gave meaning to a medium that has no 'content'.

                <p>
                    This reading made me think about how a lot of things are communicated and expressed differently depending on what the medium is 
                    and how it is used. How we think, feel, and interact is now influenced by how we see technology and use it in our daily lives. 
                    Human affairs are controlled and affected by the message every new technology innovations. 
                    The medium has the power to bring about change and growth into this world, it has control over different parts people take in everyday life.
                    Every medium has its own meaning, it is all about how people interpret it or use it and thus affecting human relationships.
                    From my point of view, McLuhan gives us an insight into how the growth of mediums or technology affects the way we as people think and interact with one another. 
                    It is how we interact with the evolving technology that gives and shows its message. I found this reading really interesting
                    because we live in a world where we try to find meaning in everything we do, use
                    and everything we interact with. How we use the medium as technology evolves has its own social and personal effects. 
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    McLuhan makes us understand what our interaction with the medium brings, and how we end up making sense of the technology we use.
                    He gives a coherent emphasis on how meaning is brought about by the medium and how other things cannot be interpreted as a communication medium.
