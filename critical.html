                    Reflection back to the weekly blog posts I did for this website, I can say that I have increased my knowledge and views
                    when it comes to the improtance of information and how it shapes the world and hoe technological augmentations have changed, altered, and reserved that information. 
                    In week 2's reflective writing I chose to reflect on McLuhan's <em>The Medium is the Message</em> (1994).
                    I chose this reading specifically because I thought there was a lot to learn from it, and indeed this was the case, the author explains to us and argues that what we do with
                    a material gives out its meaning and message but the information and content can be  produced by materials that have verbal communication (1994: 204), what this simply means 
                    is that the materials such as a desk for exmaple, with no verbal modes do not create content this is so because the message or meaning of the desk will be produced or formed by how people use it,
                    either to place things on a steady flat surface or write on. The reading made me think a lot about how technological innovations have changed the way we recieve content and the way we use different
                    materials to get content, which led me to relect on What browsers are and how they work for the week 4's reflective writing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use the Interenet to access and/ or share information, and browsers are what we use to do all this. So, a browser then is a concept used to classify a 
                    user interfaces that let the user to easily read and write text online. I found this reading very  interesting as it can help explain to someone who knows know about how the Internet works to know more about it
                    and how the information is reached, I used blog posts on <a class="url-ref" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/what-is-a-browser/#:~:text=A%20web%20browser%20takes%20you%20anywhere%20on%20the%20internet.,are%20transmitted%20on%20the%20web" class="u-url">Mozilla</a> (2022) 
                    and <a class="url-ref" href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/browser" class="u-url">Techtarget</a> (2022) to explain this topic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Week 6's post was on the importance of accessibility and this was something to think about for my design of this website, it discussed the importance of making sure that the web is accessible to everyone whether with disabilities or not.
                    I took this theory into consideration for designing user interfaces and user experiences that were going to be suitable and accessible to everyone, which met the important aspects of accessibility, to name a few, motor, vision, and cognitive aspects. I used a couple of
                    blog posts online to help with this research and they were very educational. Then week 9 was more of and in-depth analysis and dicussion of a text that discussed geographies of information, to reflect on it I broke it down bit by bit and made sure I discussed and added views on
                    how the authors structured their research and arguments then concluded with explaining how this research gave out information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then week 12 was more of a critical analysis on my UX nad UI and how they helped with the process of the designed, I will say the I really reflected and explained the hows and whys of my decisions.
                    I enjoyed explaining the desisions I made and how they participated in meaning creation. Week 14 gave a reflective writing on what internet is and how it gives out content, the impacts of it on society, 
                    and if there is design justice on the web, this theoey was food for thought and how societal norms are shaped by  the information we consume.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, writing a blog post on JavaScript dependencies was really interesting because I knew little to nothing about dependecies and how there are different types of then which can affect projects in different ways,
                    I used the dependency on my project to bring a more responsive navigation and interaction.
