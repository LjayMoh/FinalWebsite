                    We have seen that the growth in technological innovations has shaped our political, economic, cultural, and social interactions.
                    We shape the internet by the way we interact with it and in return it shapes our environments, to simply explain this, we use the 
                    internet in our everyday lives, to access information and share information. The information we get on the internet then controls our 
                    daily activities and how we think, this is because it has links with technologies, and the media (Orgad, 2007:34). Let us now think about 
                    how the internet can affect our society both negatively and positively. Firstly, let me simply explain what the words internet and society mean.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Internet</strong>: This is a global network that is responsible for wireless connections and communications, people can access any 
                    information they want from politics, academics, health care, and so on. This information is easily accessed using computers or cell phones to go online,
                    which means connecting to the internet, and using the Web to browse and search for the information.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    <strong>Society</strong>: This is a common word, that simply means a group of people (community), with common beliefs, traditions, histories, 
                    interests, cultures, and political powers.  
                </p>
                        
                <p>
                    <h1 class="ref">Impacts of the Internet on society.</h1>
                    <p>
                        Our social relations depend more on the internet, we no longer find the need to have physical communications with others.
                        Online communication is now a norm, it has changed our lives in a way that we can now interact with people who are far from us to reach.
                        People offer one another support on social issues and show engagement through online communication, like having free online discussions on social media (Orgad, 2007: 36-37).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The internet has positive impacts which benefit society, government, and corporations, these are, it keeps on providing us with knowledge 
                        and a lot of social interactions take place there. It strengthens and promotes business interconnections because it is a communication space
                        where ideas and information can be shared or promoted. As it is an area for communication, it has made our lives much easier because we can now
                        access the latest news there, we can apply for jobs online, and we can also pursue our academics online. We do not have to go shopping anymore,
                        as we can do online shopping and get the equipment delivered to our doorsteps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Negative impacts of the internet on our societies are that criminals now have a platform to do their illegal doings, and people can get scammed easily, 
                        for example, when they could purchase goods online then not get the delivery as promised. A lot of young people experience low self-esteem because of social 
                        networks when they compare themselves to the “influencers” who show the good side of their lifestyles on social media. Most people do not find the need to interact
                        and communicate with other people intellectually and personally, instead, they share how they feel on social communication networks and express their emotions using emojis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The information we get from the internet has affected our mindsets as a society, to a point where we are quick to judge other people when they do not do things the way we
                        are expected to, for example, there is a group called Nudists & Naturists that I found out about on a podcast called <em>Podcast and Chill with MacG</em> (2022), the group
                        is about being free and not leaving life based on societal norms, the people who are part of this group walk around naked, and this is not to show off their bodies but to be
                        free and adore nature, being comfortable in their skin, body, and soul. As a society, most of us think walking around in public naked is either crazy or could be a result of witchcraft, 
                        which is just insane; we never try to understand their perspectives unless we are willing to hear the reasons behind their choices. One thing about our societies now, is we make even little 
                        coincidences trend on the internet, in like seconds if not minutes, that is how fast information is shared now. The internet is used to spread lies, hate, and violence which can psychologically affect us, 
                        and children of a younger age as some contents are not age-restricted. Now paying attention to all these negative impacts of the internet and integrating them with the positive ones, I believe can bring justice to how different Webs are created.

                    <h1 class="ref">Design Justice for the Web.</h1>
                    <p>
                        What exactly does this phrase mean? Design justice for the Web? Does it have to do with accessibility and good UI and UX? The phrase has a lot of sense to it than we could ever think. 
                        The Web is known as a system or platform that we access through the internet by utilizing a web browser, it is mostly used for accessing information and contributing to the space of communication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, I will break down the phrase; the design is a doing word, which in <em>Oxford Dictionary</em> means to “decide upon the look and functioning of (a building, garment, or other objects), by making a detailed drawing of it”,
                        this simply means that it is the process of planning a specific design and running through ideas before the final product. All this planning is the foundation of the product, we can then think of a design as the user experience,
                        because it is a whole process of prototyping, wireframing, and arranging ideas together to create a specific product. Justice on the other hand, according to the <em>Oxford Dictionary</em>, is “just behavior or treatment”, this in simple terms is being fair.
                        Integrating the two terms, design justice, means the planning process of a specific product that has equality and allows disadvantaged people to contribute to the process. The process considers inequality and includes groups of people under the pressure
                        of colonialism and capitalism in the design process (Costanza-Chock, 2020:19). Design justice can be a process used to dismantle unfairness, for example, letting Africans contribute to the user experience of a product that is targeted to them will bring justice to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Applying design justice to the Web can try to lessen the negative impacts that the internet has on society. This will include opening a wider space for everyone whether affected by capitalism, colonialism, and social pressure or not 
                        to take part in the design processes and share their opinions fairly. It will also mean that the participation of other countries in the information that is shared and changed will be taken into consideration, for instance, there will 
                        be more Webs that will give out information in any language like the African language (Sesotho) rather than English-language.
