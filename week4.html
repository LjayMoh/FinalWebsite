                Depending on how we use the Internet,
                it has changed how we interact with one another, how we work, and definitely has affected our mindsets. 
                We use it every day whether for work or school, to access information. Most people know about application programs, in this case,
                browsers; but do they really know how they work? Do they ever think about the process the words they typed on the address bar go 
                through before the information they requested can be displayed on their devices? 
                I had no idea how browsers worked myself until now that we are learning about them, they play a big role in how we interact with the Internet. 
                Now let us think about what a browser is and how its aspects interact with one another to give use information on the Web.

                <h2 class="foot">What is a Browser?</h2>
                <p>
                  The word "browser" emerged preceding the Web as a term for user interfaces that let you navigate through the page and read the text online. 
                  It lets the user look at the information they are searching for on the World Wide Web (www). A World Wide Web is an information sytem which is accessible
                  on the internet  through URLs(Uniform Resource Locators) which identify os classify documents and other web resources (Tech Target, 2022).
                  This includes looking at images, web pages, and videos. A user is able to search for whatever information they are lokking for when using a browser,
                  for instance, it could be locale, geographic, social, political, or eductaional information. A browser is used by the end-users,
                  as it can be identified as an application program that provides interaction between the user and the internet.
                  It uses HTTP(HyperText Transfer Protocol) which is a protocol about how information is exchanged between a client and the server, 
                  to make requests of the server throughout the internet on behalf of the user.
                </p>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Web browsers have allowed us to access the websites we want to visit on the internet,
                this shows that the internet plays a big part in our lives, any information we want to find or access can now be found on the internet.
                Although Web browsers are not the same and may or may not function the same way, software designers use common features to design them, 
                these are, a home button- which takes the user to a default homepage; a Web address bar- allowing the user to input a Web address of the website they wish to visit; 
                back and forward buttons- which allow the user to move to the next and previous page; refresh button- to reload a Web page; 
                stop button- to cancel what the user has searched for and end the communication with a server;
                tabs- allowing users to open multiple websites, and bookmarks-which allow users to select specific websites of their choice. 
                Many browsers also have plug-ins that allow the user to add security features to their browser (Mozilla, 2022).

                <h2 class="foot">How do Browsers work?</h2> 
                <p>
                  Web browsers that we are most familiar with are Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Lynx, Safari, Edge, Flock, and Internet Explorer.
                  The one that is used most of the time is Chrome, because it is the fastest browser. 
                  The growth in information and communication technology has made users use the internet every second, especially to promote learning and teaching.
                  Most researchers or scholars use browsers to access data that they will need to conduct their work, it is very unlikely for users not to find the information they need since most 
                  browsers have different languages for users to choose whatever language they prefer to understand the content better.
                </p>
              </p> 
             
                
              <p>
                Web browsers use the client-server model, whereby the phone browser acts as the client, 
                being the one responsible for forwarding a request and communicating with the server, 
                the server then sends back a response to the browser which will then construct and render the information needed by the user on the device.
                It is made up of integrated parts including the user interface which allows for the interaction between the browser and the user. 
                The browser engine examines the rendering engine, and the rendering engine interprets HTML or XML documents for the requested Web page. 
                Every Web page on the browser has its own URL( Uniform Resource Locator) which is the web address.
              </p> 

              <p>
                  The use of browsers have made our lifes much easier, we no longer have to go to libraries to get the books we want to do research since we can access them on the internet.
                  We do not have to watch televisions anymore to see the latest news or movies, we can do all that on the internet. No matter where we are we can easily access information from other parts of the world through
                  the internet. Technology innovations have helped businesses grow massively as corporations can now share their ideas and information through the internet where everyone can access it. Even the governments are now
                  talking to theirs people through the internet because information can travel faster. Everything is about the internet!
