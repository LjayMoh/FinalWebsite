                    First of all, we have to understand what accessibility is, according to Oxford Dictionary, 
                    the term accessibility is defined as "the quality of being easy to obtain or use".
                    This simply means that it is about making all things reachable and usable for everyone whether disabled or not. Everyone can easily participate on the Web by
                    navigating, understanding, and interacting with it without any inequalities. What I meaan when I say without any inequalities is that, it equally benefits people with 
                    and without inequalities. Accessicilty is ver important in many aspects of our lifes, this includes, education, health care, jobs, recreation, and many more (Henry,2005).
                    There are quite a number of aspects of accessibility namely, motor, cognitive, vision, hearing, and speech (UNC Greensboro, 2019), which I will briefly discuss. 
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    The focus here is specifically on web accessibility, which is the comprehensive implementation of making sure that all people 
                    including those with all types of disabilities are able to interact with the websites and can easily reach them on the World Wide Web.
                    Web accessibility ensures that disabled people do not feel excluded from using and reaching certain sites. 
                    Depending on how the sites are designed and taking the aspects of accessibility into consideration it can determine whether the site is easily accessible or not.
                    Physical disability is not the only thing that can stop users from easily reaching the sites they want to reach,
                    there is also situational disability which is when a person experiences a limit built on their current situation or experience. Web accessibility is created by the integration of 
                    digital tools which are web browsers, technologies, and many more "user agents" and websites (Henry,2005). Looking at the aspects that help web designers check if their webs are
                    accessible will help us better understand what web accessibility is.

                <p>
                    The motor aspect focuses on how the user navigates the website, for instance,
                    there should be accessible controllers for users who cannot navigate by means of the keyboards or mouses; 
                    having areas that are large and clickable helps users who cannot use a mouse with precision. 
                    Some people have difficulties remembering things easily or learning fast this is the cognitive aspect of accessibility, 
                    when a site has too much content for the user and it is not written in simple language and there are no illustrations to make them understand 
                    the content faster, users with a concussion and/or dyslexia will find it hard to understand the content.
                    Having animations, instructional diagrams, and illustrations can help those with difficulty learning to better understand the content on the websites. 
                    Making the images and text on the website large will make it easier for poor-sighted users to easily read the content understandably so, 
                    this focuses on the visual aspect of web accessibility. When the code used for the site is semantically relevant HTML, 
                    it will assist users with blindness using text-to-speech software to know what the site is about. 
                    Using color-blind-friendly colors on the website and underlining important texts or links ensures that color-blind users easily notices them.
                    Having subtitled animations or videos included in the website can help users with failure hearing be able to understand the content, 
                    the subtitles must be clearly readable with clear formatting. 
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    Web accessibility saves people a lot of money as most websites can be accessed for free in the World Wide Web,
                    we can access every information we want in the Internet. Accessibility is important as it provides equal access to everyone and 
                    does not exclude people with conditions, it advances usability and makes user experience effective and most importantly it allows everyone
                    in our societies to participate freely.
