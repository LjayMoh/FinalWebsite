                The first step I took before designing this website was to sketch out the wireframes.
                The wireframes helped to give me start-up ideas of how I wanted the webpages to look like. I thought about the structure of my website and what 
                information I should put in different pages following the rubric for this assignment. Then I decided to make sections that were going to hold the information in each blog post.
                My initial goal was to keep everything simple and easy to understand, also make the website easy to navigate. I used the feedback I received for the first website to make 
                this one better. From the layout of the web pages to the graphics, I downloaded universe images for the background, this is because they are not too busy like the images I used in the first website.
                I did not want to use color for the background because I felt like it was going to be boring. I then designed the Home page and and its layout, this was my startup point because its interface is the face of the website,
                and the user will engage with it to navigate through to other pages. I watched tutorials on YouTube by <a href="https://youtu.be/zAjDc1HPgYM?list=PL3pyLl-dgiqBSBsC5O5AQHN1UsUk-60nc">Awa Melvine</a> to help me add the footer
                and make the autoplay slider display for the blog posts.

               <span><i class="far fa-calendar"> 25-30 May, 2022</i></span>
               <p>
                On these days, I worked on the html files and CSS styling for the blog posts, I went for similar layouts for all the pages and decided to make the background image a dark universe with shooting stars. I went for this dark background
                because the color of the text is cream white so I did not want to use a busy background that would make the text difficult to read, since from the feedback I got, most of the test was blending in the background so I did not want that to happen this time
                around. I went back to read the critical writings and I realized I did not give much of my thoughts on some of the discussions, even the feedback stated that, so I reread the information on each post and added more of my thoughts to them. Adding the footer element 
                to all the pages was a major decision, and using java script to style the slider was quite an interesting experience. I put all the links to other pages in every page, because it gave accessibility to the user so they can be able to access any page they wanted at any given time. 
                I also designed the interfaces to have the same structure from top to bottom so that the user does not get confused as they browse from page to page.

                Most of the coding was just copy and paste from the first website, then I just added some touch ups to improve the website. I enjoyed working on this website and writing more critical reflections, 
                because with the first website I did not pay much attention to what other html coding elemets meant, like the nav element which I used to wrap some of my information in the pages. I found out that it is not used for
                that while designing this website, it is used to wrap the list of content and links to other pages. One of the major decisions I made also during these days were to change the layout of my profile page and the homepage, this is because 
                I felt like in the first website there was not much work done on making the interfaces attractive and easy to navigate.

               <span><i class="far fa-calendar"> 04-09 June, 2022</i></span>
               <p>
                During these last days before the assignment submission, I worked on the final touch ups, these included making sure that the layout could fit small screen sizes and working on spelling errors, I increased and decreased the font size were it was needed
                to cover the screen size. I realized that I did not annotate the wireframes to best demonstrate the website pages, so I went back to fix that so that the user could understand the idea behind each wireframe which lead to the design of the final website.
                Then I attached the files to my GitHub repository, I attached the files after the final design because I did not want to end up forgetting to push changes I made for the website. I also felt like it will save me a lot of work.

               <h1 class="ref">Looking back</h1>
               <p>
                   Overall the design process was not that difficult and I improved my website design the best way I could, the tips I got and the feedbacks were very helpful for this process because I knew this time what to do and what not to do. 
                   I am looking forward to learning more and improving my website designs. I failed to use a lot of JavaScript styling because I could not understand some of its methods, but I am working on that, by viewing as many tutorials as I can to best understand the coding.
                   From the process of this deigning this website I have learned that there are small mistakes that can break a developer's code, and finish a project that involves coding you have to start working on it immediately because it can be a long process.
                   Writing down ideas and sketching the wireframes every week helped me improve my website, I also went further to prototype it and ask for reviews or feedbacks from people near me, the feedbacks helped me to decide on the UI/UX designs and add more ideas that had skipped my mind to the project. 
                   I can proudly say that thus far I have accomplished most of the goals I was aiming for for this website.
               </p>

               <h1 class="ref">How the whole process was until the final website</h1>
               <p>
                   From designing the first website to the last, I found the process really fun and it strengthened my ability to adapt to new program languages I use in my projects. I have always considered myself having a lot of strength when it comes to design and art, but in designing this website I think
                   it was a bit hard to think of the suitable design that was going to allow the user to navigate the web pages effortlessly and understand the thought behind my designs. In the first website, I faced challenges when it came to the user experience, for example, I could not add a footer to the web pages, this is 
                   totally on me, because I did not do enough research; besides that I have always had a weakness when it comes to coding. My initial idea was to always use background images for the web pages, because I wanted to attract the user and show some creativity, but this was a problem because a most of the text on the pages blended in with the colors on the images, I would say the 
                   images were too busy and were not that necessary. In the second and final websites I still used different images for the web  pages' backgrounds and this time around I made sure I use images that were not too busy and were darker to fit the white font color perfectly. And I was able to add a footer to all the web pages which allowed the user to navigate 
                   freely and effortlessly from page to page in the website, I consider this as one of my accomplishments, because I put a lot of work into the code and styling.

               </p>
               <p>
                   I used Times New Roman font family for all my projects and the size was ranging between 20-30px depending on the view height of the screen and how bold or light I wanted the text to be. I used this font family because it is one that most users can be familiar with and it is not too decorated which would exaggerate the design and seem 
                   too complex to read. I wanted to keep the readability of the website simple and easy to understand, so this font family helped me achieve that goal. The theoretical side of the project I can say was not that difficult but a bit challenging as well, I tried by all means to give the best reflection I could in every reading or theory I engaged with and 
                   the thinking process was not easy, but I was able to engage with each theory and understand the message each was trying to convey, I went further to do my own research on the topics I interacted with and had to do crital writing on, the research was elightening and assisted me with the thinking process. Reading and hearing what other people thought 
                   about the specific concept as well as their ideas and opinions added more information to was communicated. The research I did further served as an adavantage for me to understand and try to bring my own voice into the theories I engaged with in this course and through out the semester.
               </p>
               <p>
                   I believe I improved my coding and design abilities during the process of designing this website. I also got to improve my writing skills and structure my arguments in the best way possible using additional research and theories. Even though I faced some challenges with the JavaScript program language, I still managed to look further into it and understand how it works.
                   The last blog post on JavaScript dependencies, was really interesting and eye-opening on what using other people's codes can do to your project. I made further research on the topic and I enjoyed reading about it, overall I enjoyed engaging with all the readings and applying them to my work and integrating them till I designed the final product. 
                   The feedbacks I got for the two assignments and watching tutorial videos on YouTube were the foundation of the augmentations in my final website.
